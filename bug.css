The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results.  For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` is a valid use, but `width: calc(100% - 10px) + 5px;` is invalid and may cause issues.  Another issue can occur if units are not consistently used within the `calc()` function; mixing percentages and pixels without proper considerations can result in unexpected behavior.
